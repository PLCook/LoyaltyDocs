<p id="press_release03">New Book Gives Insight into the Role Loyalty Plays in Today's Economy<br><br>

Louisville, KY - Loyalty: From the Battlefield to the Boardroom isn't the first book to examine the role of loyalty in today's economy, but the Loyalty Docs have brought together an unprecedented body of knowledge and distilled the lessons for you.<br><br>

It's rare to get ten minutes with these generals and admirals; Drs. Stanley and Alfred Frager spent hundreds of hours in personal interviews to gather perspectives never previously revealed. This unparalleled and unprecedented access to America's top military and business leaders allowed the Loyalty Docs to chart a course for loyalty. Now they share that knowledge with you.<br><br>

The Loyalty Docs gathered the best of America's military and asked: why would people join an organization whose purpose is to fight similar organizations to the death? What does the military know that the rest of us do not? They found the answers to these questions, and then took them to corporate leaders to get their feedback and insights and to share how loyalty can best be developed in the business world. Those strategies and methods are revealed in this book, along with practical examples and inspiring stories from America's best.
<br><br>
The Loyalty Docs have created a book that will change the way employees, managers and executives view loyalty today. Loyalty: From the Battlefield to the Boardroom will give you what you need to create and develop a loyal workforce.<br><br>
