        	    <h3><i>Stanley R. Frager, PhD.</i></h3>
        		
                    <p>Dr. Stan Frager has successfully trained and spoken to thousands of participants through his customized, high impact seminars and workshops. Among the organizations to have benefited from Dr. Stan's insights are Xerox, IBM, AT&T, Humana, Coca Cola, KFC, the IRS, and the U.S. Army, to name a few. He was the past president of the National Speakers Association-Kentucky and is a longtime member of the American Society for Training and Development. He was awarded the 2000 Kentucky Chapter Member of the Year award for the NSA and has made over 2,000 paid speaking appearances over the past 30 years. Dr. Stan knows how to give a great presentation. He was able to use those performances to sell over ten thousand copies of his previous book, The Champion within You. He is excited about the opportunity to turn Loyalty: From the Battlefield to the Boardroom into another keynote speech and outsell his previous book.</p>

                    <p>Experienced in both television and radio interviews, Dr. Stan has received recognition as an author, an award-winning filmmaker, and a national talk show host. He plans on using his current nationally-syndicated radio show as a platform to sell Loyalty: From the Battlefield to the Boardroom through a special edition during the book's debut and through continuously presenting related guests to discuss the book. Dr. Stan knows how to market.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Stan is Professor Emeritus at the University of Louisville. He has taught graduate-level courses with highly-rated reviews and evaluations. He has a knack for teaching high-level professionals difficult concepts. While Loyalty seems like an easy concept to grasp, its application is difficult unless presented in a manner in which Dr. Stan has done thousands of times. Dr. Stan knows how to teach.</p>
                    <p>As if giving keynote speeches, hosting a radio show, writing, and teaching was not enough to keep him busy, he is also the former president of a large mental health clinic with 15 health professionals for 35 years. He works hard and is very ambitious. Dr. Stan knows how to lead and develop business. As a cancer survivor of 37 years, Stan also brings life experience and perseverance to everything he does.</p>
                    <p>As a Scoutmaster Extraordinaire, Stan has been instrumental in the achievements of over 100 Eagle Scouts during his 24 year tenure as Scoutmaster. He is a former member of the Army Science Board and a consultant to the command staff of the 101 Airborne Division, Ft. Campbell, US Army recruiting command and Ft Knox command staff. He is a sports psychologist to Olympic, professional, amateur and collegiate athletes including the University of Louisville and University of Kentucky. Dr. Stan knows how to lead and develop others to do the same.</p>

                    <h3><i>Alfred J. Frager, PhD.</i></h3>
                    <p>Dr. Alfred Frager is an experienced consultant in change management and organizational development, specializing in culture change, as well as team and leadership development. He designed and implemented many team and leadership development seminars and workshops that led to increased team effectiveness, communication, and collaboration. Dr. Alfred has done organizational development consulting with a diverse variety of organizations. One of these workshops was conducted with a non-profit organization in Guatemala, where he led two other consultants to conduct an organizational analysis, developed mentor culture, and improved employee selection practices. As a consultant for Saint Louis University's Center for Interprofessional Education and Research, Dr. Alfred had lead roles in assessment and evaluation projects regarding interprofessional education programs designed to improve teamwork, leadership, and collaboration among 11 health care professions toward improvement in patient care. As a result of his recommendations, educational interventions were designed or modified to help maximize learning of these skills. Working with the Dean of Saint Louis University's medical school, he developed, implemented and evaluated a training program designed to help fourth-year medical students improve patient quality and safety. He consulted with over 17 different organizations nationwide to match personality factors with performance measures in efforts that cut company costs through improved hiring and retention practices. </p>
                    <p>Dr. Alfred can use these experiences and his educational background to help turn the General's lessons into actionable recommendations that work and can demonstrate effectiveness. Dr. Alfred earned his PhD from Saint Louis University in Industrial and Organizational Psychology. He has extensive training in leadership, team dynamics, organizational culture, and organizational change. </p>
                    <p>However, even before he began graduate school he worked full-time for a large mental health clinic as its Practice Administrator and Director of Marketing and Research, increasing the firm's revenues 300 percent during his time there. During his undergraduate capstone course, he conducted an individual consulting project that reconciled industry perception comparisons of dental-product firms with quality control measures within his client's company. </p> 
                    <p>Dr. Alfred's focus on making critical judgments from solid qualitative and quantitative research can quickly give further credibility to any organization's efforts and provides great insight in developing organizational loyalty.  He has developed surveys that demonstrated strong evidence for validity and reliability. He has also designed, led and evaluated countless focus groups and interviews.  He has published papers in academic journals and presented research at many health care and I/O psychology-related conferences.</p>
